review: Groomer.io is the beessssttttttt! After meeting with, and trying various software companies, we ve been using Groomer.io for over a year now. We recently enabled intake pages, online booking, pay ahead, and deposits for all new clients, and our business is so thankful! We are making more money due to fewer cancellations, quick and efficient check-ins, and check-outs, and less time spent scheduling and rescheduling. The customer service is top notch, and they are very receptive to our feedback. If you accidentally delete an entire client like we have, no prob bob, Groomer io has your back. We are big fans and look forward to seeing how this software grows with our business.
