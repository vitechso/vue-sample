  - Some people like to see blocks, others like maps, and even some like slots. We have every style but doggie.
  - Slots are geared towards the fast-paced busy shop. Make sure you don’t overbook a groomer at a specific time. This works really well with online booking.
  - Blocks are good for customers that like to visualize appointment times, durations, and have lots of pet photos.
  - Maps are specialized for mobile groomers helping you schedule efficiently.
faqs:
  - question: Can I switch between different styles?
    answer: Absolutely, in fact it’s one tap away at any time.
  - question: Can I use block or slot scheduling even if I’m a mobile groomer?
    answer: Yes. And we think you will find it a great compliment to your map!
