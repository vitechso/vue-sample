                    <li><strong>Governing Law</strong> and Jurisdiction PARTIES agree that the Contract shall be deemed to have been made and executed in the State of California, U.S. Any Dispute (as defined below) arising under the Contract shall be resolved in accordance with U.S. federal law and the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of laws of any jurisdiction. PARTIES agree if Section 14.2 below is deemed to be null and void, all Disputes arising between PARTIES under the Contract shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the San Luis Obispo Superior Court and the western division of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. PARTIES hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts and submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts.</li>

                    <li><strong>Binding Arbitration Agreement</strong> Both PARTIES and each of their respective subsidiaries, affiliates, and Representatives agree that any dispute, action, or other controversy (“Dispute”) with respect to the Contract shall be resolved by binding arbitration. PARTIES acknowledge that these TOS and YOUR use of the Digital Properties evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce. The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §1, et seq., shall control any arbitration proceedings commenced under this Section 14.2. Arbitration shall be the exclusive dispute resolution process. YOU understand that YOU and GROOMER.IO are giving up the right to sue in court and to have a trial before a judge or jury.

                      <ol class="iner-list">
                        <li>Either YOU or GROOMER.IO may commence arbitration by sending a written notice of intent to arbitrate to the other party. Such notice shall (i) describe the nature and basis of the matter and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought.</li>

                        <li>The arbitrator shall apply the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where applicable, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes, both of which are available at <a href="https://groomer.io/%E2%80%9Chttp://www.adr.org%E2%80%9D">http://www.adr.org.</a> The Contract shall control to the extent it conflicts with the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The arbitrator shall comply with the terms of the Contract.</li>

                        <li>All arbitrations shall take place in the County of San Luis Obispo, California. YOU may request a telephonic hearing pursuant to the AAA rules.

                        <li>All decisions of the arbitrator shall be final, binding, and conclusive on all parties. Judgment may be entered upon any such decision in accordance with applicable law in any court of competent jurisdiction.

                        <li>The PARTIES shall share equally all initial costs of arbitration. All arbitration proceedings shall be closed to the public and confidential. All records relating thereto shall be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award.</li>

                        <li>This Section 14.2 does not prevent YOU from bringing YOUR Dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government consumer protection agencies that can, if the law allows, seek relief from GROOMER.IO on your behalf.</li>

PARTIES agree that they shall not bring or participate in any class action, private attorney general action, collective arbitration, or any other proceeding in which either party acts in a representative capacity, even if AAA’s procedures or rules would otherwise allow such action. PARTIES also agree that if this Section 14.3 is found to be unenforceable, then Section 14.2 above and any other provision of the Contract concerning mandatory arbitration shall not apply to any action involving a purported class or representative proceeding, and such actions between PARTIES shall proceed, if at all, in accordance with Section 14.1 above.</li>
