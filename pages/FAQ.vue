                <h3>How does the app generate more revenue?</h3>
                <p>It’s common to think that in order to make more money, you need more customers, but in reality, you
                  just need the same customers you already have, to book appointments more frequently. Groomer.io
                  automatically contacts customers with a friendly SMS message after 6 weeks encouraging your customers
                  to schedule another appointment.</p>

                <h3>Do I have to use the comeback reminder feature?</h3>
                <p>All automated messages are optional. You may turn them on and off at any time.</p>

                <h3>How much will I pay?</h3>
                <p>As your business fluctuates in sales with the seasons, so can your pricing. Our base rate is 69¢ per
                  customer served per month with discounts at higher volume. An appointment is considered 1 person, no
                  matter how many pets belong to your client. You can add as many customers into the system free of
                  charge. You are only billed for customers that are scheduled, and canceled appointments do not count
                  toward your bill. The short answer is, we only make money, when you make money.</p>

                <h3>Are canceled or no-show appointments billed to my account?</h3>
                <p>Because of our state of the art notification system, we take full responsibility for any canceled or
                  no show appointments. You will not be billed for appointments that did not generate your business any
                  money.</p>
